            <blockquote>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
                not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
                measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to
                accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

            <p>The kAI Lab, led by Dr. Kaiqun Fu, focuses on advancing artificial intelligence, data mining, and machine
                learning techniques for analyzing complex spatiotemporal systems. kAI lab develops innovative
                computational models and algorithms to tackle real-world challenges in transportation, public safety,
                environmental monitoring, and socio-economic systems.</p>

            <p>
                Urban computing is experiencing an increasing amount of attention. Modern urban computing is an
                interdisciplinary study in which critical urban issues are studied using state-of-the-art computing
                technologies such as spatial data mining and machine learning. My research interests span the areas of
                urban computing: <i>spatiotemporal data mining</i>, <i>GeoAI</i>, <i>social media analysis</i>, and <i>machine
                learning</i>'s application in spatiotemporal event forecasting. My studies can bring value to a wide
                range of crucial domains, such as social event detection and monitoring, transportation-related incident
                detection and impact prediction, urban safety perception, and various spatiotemporal-related
                interdisciplinary applications.

                        This project will develop 1) a novel multimodal representation learning approach combining
                        machine learning and graph mining to learn the text-enriched embedding of the traffic events
                        from heterogenous social/news media and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) networks, 2)
                        novel spatiotemporal data mining and transformer-based graph neural network methods to detect
                        transportation events and their cascading impacts on heterogeneous ITS networks, 3) a new
                        physicsinformed machine learning solution to model the cascading impacts with the Korteweg-de
                        Vries (KdV ) equation and inject model interpretability while forecasting the traffic events in
                        specific scenarios. These advancements will make significant contributions to the fields of
                        explainable graph mining, physics-informed machine learning, and spatiotemporal event analysis.
                        The expected outcomes will enrich our understanding of the nature of traffic events in complex
                        ITS networks. The methodologies developed could revolutionize other research areas, offering a
                        fresh perspective on spatiotemporal event analysis and paving the way for more data-efficient
                        Artificial Intelligence applications across various Cyber-Physical Systems landscapes.

                        This proposal encompasses three primary initiatives: 1) Forecasting Emergence in Science and
                        Technology (S&T) Areas Using Multimodal Machine Learning: This involves leveraging machine
                        learning to assess the potential of various technology areas evolving from earlystage
                        experimental concepts to transformative research products with wide-ranging applications. 2)
                        Evaluating the Societal and Economic Impact of Leading Research Organizations Regionally with
                        Deep Graph Neural Networks: Utilizing geolocation data and historical research collaboration
                        records, this objective introduces an innovative approach using graph neural networks. This
                        method aims to model the science and technology trends of leading organizations and their
                        societal and economic impacts at regional and national levels. 3) A Data-Driven Hybrid Approach
                        to Monitor Workforce Development Demographics: This proposal suggests combining interactive,
                        data-driven methods with traditional data collection techniques to track the career development
                        of individuals involved in these technology areas. The research goals outlined in this proposal
                        are inherently interdisciplinary, requiring seamless collaboration among Computer Scientists,
                        Sociologists, and Economists. The developed technical approaches will make significant research
                        contributions to the fields of spatial data mining, graph neural networks and S&T trends and
                        impact predictions and beneficial in light of the recent NSF Engines initiative.

                        The objectives of this project are to (i) develop a foundation model to fuse time series
                        multi-modal data; (ii) fine-tune the foundation model for mapping soil moisture, fuel moisture
                        content, and fuel load in near-real-time and for any satellite data acquisition dates; and (iii)
                        explain the foundation and fine-tuned models to identify model improvement requirement. The
                        multi-modal data include HLS multi-spectral reflectance, Sentinel-1A to -1C C-band SAR and NISAR
                        L-band SAR, and data. The project will deliver the training data, the trained foundation models,
                        fine-tuned models for soil moisture, fuel moisture content, and fuel load retrieval, and the
                        developed software and codes. The algorithms will be quasi-operational, i.e., ready-to-use to
                        operationally generate surface parameters when deployed in a system which can access these
                        multi-modal data in near-real-time. The models will be built using data across the conterminous
                        United States (CONUS) and expected to work anywhere anytime in CONUS. In addition, the project
                        will analyze and understand the uncertainty of the retrieved parameters and its sensitivity to
                        model size, training sample size by understanding and interpreting the developed models.
